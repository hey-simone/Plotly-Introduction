# Plotly-Introduction

Visualisation packages are a critical component in any data scientist's toolkit. They help in understanding the data and in finding __patterns__ and __outliers__ that are not immediately obvious from tabular data. They are also integral in evaluating the __performance__ of learning algorithms. This is why it can be beneficial to try new offerings like __Plotly__ and consider if incorporating them into a workflow would be beneficial.
